**Status:** {Draft | In Review | Approved}
**Owner:** {Name/Role}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}

---

## 1. Executive Summary

{Provide a concise overview (2-4 paragraphs) covering: (1) the strategic driver or problem this operating model addresses, (2) the key changes being proposed, (3) expected business outcomes and success metrics, and (4) high-level timeline and resource requirements.}

---

## 2. Purpose & Strategic Context

Describe the strategic rationale for this operating model design. {2-3 paragraphs covering: (1) alignment with organization's vision and strategic priorities, (2) external factors (market shifts, competitive pressures, regulatory changes) driving change, (3) internal factors (growth, performance gaps, technical debt) necessitating this design. Be specific about cause and effect.}

---

## 3. Design Principles

List 3-7 core principles that guided the design of this operating model. {Each principle should: (1) be stated as a clear imperative or preference, (2) explain what it means in practice, (3) be specific enough to resolve design trade-offs. Format: "Principle statement" - practical interpretation.}

> Example: "Customer-centric decisions over internal convenience" - when process design conflicts arise, prioritize customer experience; "Automate routine, elevate judgment" - eliminate manual repetitive work to free capacity for strategic thinking.

---

## 4. Out of Scope

{Explicitly state what this operating model design will NOT address. List boundaries, exclusions, and items deferred to future iterations. For each item, briefly note why it is excluded (future phase, separate initiative, resource constraints, etc.) to prevent scope creep and clarify design boundaries.}

---

## 5. Current State Assessment

### Current Operating Model Overview
